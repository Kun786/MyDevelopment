What are peerDependencies: This Dependecies are open to you application means they are not pivate:

This happens for some packages after updating to npm 7.

Paramter --legacy-peer-deps can help:

npm i --legacy-peer-deps
Described here legacy-peer-deps

Causes npm to completely ignore peerDependencies when building a package tree, as in npm versions 3 through 6.

If a package cannot be installed because of overly strict peerDependencies that collide, it provides a way to move forward resolving the situation.
...

You can set this option to true by default (not recommended by npm):

npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
Or just wait until these packages get up to date.

To Solve it use this command sudo npm install -g node-gyp
