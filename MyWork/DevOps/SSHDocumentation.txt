How to generate ssh key and do operations on it.
 command: {ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096}
 this will ask you passpharase if you dont need hit enter and you key will generate
 afert that the .ssh folder will have those key it is in home directory and its hidden
 to enter you need {cd .ssh}
 
 id_rsa (private key)
 id_rsa.pub (public key)
 Note: The data is encrypted with public key and decrypted with private key.
 Public key is always on remote server
 and Private key is alwasy on client side.
 
 to check open ssh version {ssh -v localhost}
 
 
 
 Move Commands :
 Now to send file from one folder to another the command is : mv origin destination
 example {mv /home/fazi/.ssh/mykey.txt /home/fazi/Documents/}
 
 now move you file from one system to another system. we need [scp] command (secure copy).
 Command: {
 scp filename remoteSystemUserName@ip/folder
 command:scp id_rsa.pub root@139.59.25.159:/home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  }
  Easy way to copy the ssh key to the remote server

How to copy your ssh key to your server

command : fazi@ScriptOne:~ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@172.105.7.26  (-i is the input file)









  Very Important information.
  How the linux/server file structure look like.
  the first thing is you hardDrive/SSD inside it you have home anf bin folder
  /home folder have your user account on server its root by default and in root you have your application files and ssh
  
  Remember .foldername it means its hidden.
  
  so fazi@ScriptOne:/$
  here fazi is your user name of adminsitrator where as ScriptOne is the computer name
  now /$ mean you are in your c drive (if there is no partition). in this folder you have bin=programs files(x86) and home=User(from Windows) and in that home you have your current user or administrator cd~ is the path of home.
  
  
  
  Live Example
fazi@ScriptOne:~/Desktop$ ssh root@139.59.25.159

thta ip address is of my MeanStacktestingApp on digital ocean.

after running this application i get this
root@MeanStackTestingApp:~#

you see root@MeanStackTestingApp.

now here you can see the files inside the home directory.
root@MeanStackTestingApp:~#ls -a
.  ..  .bashrc  .cache  .cloud-locale-test.skip  .profile  .ssh  snap

and here you can see the .ssh folder 

root@MeanStackTestingApp:~# cd .ssh/
root@MeanStackTestingApp:~/.ssh# ls
authorized_keys
 you can see the authorized_keys file.
 
 
 
 in client side :
 fazi@ScriptOne:~$ cd .ssh/
fazi@ScriptOne:~/.ssh$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts

Here you can see the known_hosts this file contain all you history of the serve connection if you delete it. it will ask you again for the fingerprint thing.
so known_hosts save all the fingerprint servers.

note: on server at drive directory you will see a folder var
and in that var folder you have log folder and in this folder you have auth.log file this actulayy tell you how the connect setup btwenn user and server and tell you all the details step by step and 
tells you the error which you can use to avoid hacking.






now for having the config(.txt) file in the .ssh it wihh have some info. so when you try to connet or load .ssh folder it will load config file into the memory so it will try to connet host with ip address you have provided.
in the config file you could have more than one server
config file allows you to have entery point to all server


Note the public key on the server it has the mathematical link with the client side private link. so when ever you try to connect it check that link and created the link


There are multiple types of key.
1 rsa (not much secure)
2 ed25519 (which is short and more secure)

ssh-keygen -t ed25519
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "PromiseFitnessAppPublicKey"


sshd is the program that accepts connection which runs in the background.

to check the status systemctl status sshd
it should be enabled and running so we can connect via ssh

from server in etc/ssh
 there is a file called sshd_config from there we can change the port
 
 note # means comment 
 
 to check the file type:
 
 root@MeanStackAppTesting:/etc/ssh# file *


You can chnage the server configuration by setting PasswordAuthention No
and By setting rootuser to No so you can access to your own user with ssh key 
changing the port 22 to other port allow more security. so hacker cannot get into the server


curl https://ipinfo.io/134.209.149.129
hostname -I (to get your ip local address.




sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y



TroubleShooting:

timeout error: port 22 is blocked by switch or firewall
for logs :root@server:~# journalctl -fu ssh (f = follow) and then you can trouble shoot things




chown -R fazi:fazi .ssh

root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-intel-lon1-01:/home/fazi# groups fazi
fazi : fazi

root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-intel-lon1-01:/home/fazi# usermod -G sudo fazi
root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-intel-lon1-01:/home/fazi# groups fazi
fazi : fazi sudo
