I need to create angular forms that will submit and update the data. They are small forms just number fields and a boolean. The work has to be done through live share / remote and we will have to follow the code design / architecture. I can work in your time zone


Greetings

After Reading your JD I can easily do this work. You have asked to have forms that will submit and update data well I can create both Reactive and Template driven forms which can handle the data and submit it. Besides that I can offer you the following thing that you can learn by watching me coding live

1 CRUD
2 Multipart form data handling (How to handle form data with images)
3 Form Validation and custom form validation (for example the start date should not be greater than end date or password match)
4 Stop form submission if the form is invalid
5 Best design patterns that are following by the community
